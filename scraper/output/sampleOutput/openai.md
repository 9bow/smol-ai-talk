## [OpenAI](https://discord.com/channels/974519864045756446) Discord Summary

- Users across different channels expressed difficulties with the **'My Plan'** feature on the OpenAI platform, noting it wouldn't load, despite attempts across different browsers and multiple user reports. Both **ChatGPT Plus** subscriptions and usage limits were under discussion, with users like `@katthwren` and `@dsmagics` reporting being logged into the free plan despite having active Plus subscriptions, and users like `@gavin5616`, `@mustard1978`, and `@18870` discussing usage limit changes from 50 to 40 messages every 3 hours.

- Users reported technical and UI issues across the platform. Users `@zahmb` noted changes in sidebar icons on the OpenAI platform. Others reported slow performance and errors using **ChatGPT**, possibly related to plugins, with users like `@libertadthesecond` and `@exx1` discussing these issues. Users also reported on difficulties with creating, configuring, and modifying GPTs, addressing problems like URL formatting for actions, changes not saving, and difficulties executing Python code in their custom GPTs.

- A significant portion of the discussions involved using the **ChatGPT API**. Questions were posed about how to pass an API key, connect the ChatGPT API to Discord, and create API actions involving oauth2 and token usage. Users even inquired about building AI-related tools like a scraper for a mobile app.

- Differences and comparison between GPT models were explored, with users questioning the performance difference between **GPT-3** and **GPT-4**. In addition, there were in-depth discussions about potential UI enhancements, like embedding custom GPTs on websites, and improving the platform's ability to handle specific tasks, including date formatting, retrieving specific instructions from a website, and improving SEO optimisation. 

- Community members have shown willingness to share their experience and knowledge. For example, `@.kalle97` showcased his own SEO-optimized AI writing GPTs capable of producing long articles - however, he didn't share the precise formulation of the prompt. Other users lent advice on tackling common issues and advised on best practices for using and interacting with AI, like understanding that additional uploaded files to the agent don't continually modify the agent's base knowledge or identifying the potential pitfall with the Configure and Create tabs in the GPT Builder. 

- OpenAI's **credit system and top-up mechanism** was also under discussion, with contrasting opinions on the minimum top-up requirement for accessing high-performing GPT models being addressed.
