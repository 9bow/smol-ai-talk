Discussion revolved around potential consequences and a prediction about the dissolution of OpenAI.

Additionally, a significant portion of the company is expected to move with them potentially leading to the end of OpenAI. [Discussion Link](https://www.axios.com/2023/11/20/microsoft-hires-sam-altman-and-greg-brockman-to-lead-new-ai-research-unit)\n- **Future Outlook**: `@steven_ickman` stated, *\"Focus should turn to OSS models as we don’t want one company holding all the cards.\"* Expressing a preference for open-source solutions over proprietary company models. \n- **AIE Project Pitch**: `@pwuts` proposed a standard for specifying Language Model (LLM) output grammar. This would allow the use of portable, standardized methods for specifying LLM output which cloud providers could implement using low-level logic without exposing those low-level interfaces. \n- **Proposed LLM Output Segments**: `@pwuts` identified three desired types of LLM output segments: **freeform text**, **code execution**, and **function calls**, described in an XML-like specification. The last two are meant to terminate generation for post-processing before resuming.\n- **Universal Interface**: `@pwuts` argues such a universal output format would streamline AI application development and reduce vendor lock-in experienced with specific feature releases like those from OpenAI.\n\n\n### ▷ Channel: [events](https://discord.com/channels/1144960932196401252/1144960932657758212) (1 messages): \n\n- **AI/ML Events in San Francisco**: User `@interwebalchemy` asked for information about any upcoming AI/ML events happening in San Francisco next week. The reason being, their CEO wants to interact with the local AI/ML network in SF and to scout for potential hiring possibilities.\n\n\n        "
