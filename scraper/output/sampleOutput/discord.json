Letting the model output freeform text like it's trained for helps with utilizing its reasoning capabilities.\n2. `<run_code>` to let it run Python code in-prompt and enhance its reasoning with code execution (like a Jupyter notebook)\n3. `<function_call>  <name>func</name>  <args> <arg1>value</arg1> </args>  </function_call>` because the structure of XML isn't as hard to understand as JSON so could work for more models\n\nAny occurrence of 2. or 3. should terminate generation so that my application can handle execution and append the result to the prompt before continuing generation.",
